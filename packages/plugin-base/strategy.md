Let me read that tweet thread first to better understand the memecoin farming strategy.

Now THIS is what we needed! Let me revise the strategy to be properly degen and focused on memecoin farming:

**Core Farming Strategy:**

1. **New Token Detection & Entry**

- Monitor for new token deployments on Base
- Look for initial liquidity adds and first trades
- Key signals:
    - Twitter/Telegram mentions spiking
    - Gas spikes on Base (indicating ape activity)
    - First CEX listings
    - Initial volume bursts

2. **Position Structuring**

- Use V3 pools (more capital efficient)
- Set ranges strategically:
    - Bottom range ~25% below current price
    - Top range 2-3x above current price
- Focus on high fee tiers (1% or higher)
- Concentrate liquidity tightly where the action is

3. **Volume & Fee Optimization**

- Target pairs with:
    - High trading frequency (more important than size on Base)
    - Consistent volatility (fee generation)
    - Strong memetic potential (community engagement)
- Monitor fee generation rates hourly
- Move liquidity to higher fee tiers when volume justifies it

4. **Risk Profile (Maximum Degen)**

- Accept massive volatility for fee generation
- Don't worry about IL - fees should dwarf it
- Quick entry/exit based on volume patterns
- Focus on new, unproven tokens with viral potential
- No "blue chip" pairs - pure memecoin farming

5. **Position Management**

- Adjust ranges frequently based on price action
- Harvest fees aggressively
- Re-concentrate liquidity when price moves significantly
- Exit when:
    - Volume significantly drops
    - Fee generation falls below threshold
    - Token loses momentum/community interest

6. **Key Metrics to Track**

- Fee APR (targeting those 1000%+ opportunities)
- Trading frequency per block
- Gas price spikes (indicating ape activity)
- Social mentions/momentum
- Volume/TVL ratio

This is a pure degen strategy focused on:

1. Being early to new memecoin pairs
2. Maximizing fee generation through optimal positioning
3. Quick repositioning based on market activity
4. No concern for token fundamentals - pure momentum play
